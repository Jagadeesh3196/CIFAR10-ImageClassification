# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Project Highlights:

- Trained both CNN and ANN models to classify images into 10 distinct categories.
- Achieved impressive accuracy with CNN due to its ability to capture spatial features in images.
- Demonstrated the superior performance of CNN over ANN in image recognition tasks.
- Detailed comparison and analysis of results to showcase the advantages of CNN for image classification.
